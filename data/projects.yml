  slug: mirroolcreeklamb
  description: >
    A family company known for its premium quality lamb, Mirrool Creek commissioned One Iota to develop an entire brand identity, from the logo and marketing collateral through to an exciting new website. <span>The site adopts a non-traditional web design, with all the content on a single page. Condiments such as salt, olive oil and rosemary appear to float in the background as the user travels down the site. This site also used our dynamic site design that optimises itself for a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. The client is also able to maintain the site through our streamlined content management system, which their brand manager uses regularly to provide tasty lamb recipes or manage stockists.</span>
