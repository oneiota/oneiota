  description: >
    Heirloom chocolate is made from 100% organic and ethically traded single-origin cacao. Straight from bean to bar, years have gone into refining this process to its purest and most efficient form<span>. Our task was to craft a brand identity that reflected the simplicity in this process and the quality of the chocolate used. Brewed hot or cold, we designed packaging in both bottled and bagged forms using colour and basic line work to differentiate between flavours white, milk, dark and dark mocha.</span>

- project: Esplanade Coffee Brewers
  slug: espl
  description: >
    Esplanade Coffee Brewers fix brews for tourists and residents alike on the beach lined esplanade of Surfers Paradise. In a place known for its glitz and glam, they needed a brand that communicated a no-nonsense approach to quality<span>, accompanied with a bold aesthetic that would stand the test of time. Drawing inspiration from geometry and raw materials, One Iota was commissioned to deliver a brand name along with accompanying identity guidelines. Copper foil and textured brand materials integrate seamlessly within the store's interior, achieving a striking sense of quality and attention to detail.  Laser cutting and copper letterpress foiling are just a few of the processes we had fun working with when creating Esplanade's range of bespoke brand materials.</span>

- project: Taste
  slug: taste
  description: >
    Taste is a mecca for those who love to cook and entertain. From the beginning it was clear that the brand needed to reflect this passion<span>, but also create a retail environment that captured the imagination of shoppers and passersby. We delivered a bespoke identity that draws visual cues from 1920’s French typography, appropriating turn-of-the-century artwork from vintage fruit labels and cooking advertisements into playful collages with cheeky and nostalgic undertones.</span>

- project: The Illustration Room
  slug: theillustrationroom
  description: >
    The Illustration room represents a range of respected talent from across the globe. <span>They wanted an online environment where art directors and publishers could sample an illustrator’s style quickly and easily. We delivered a bespoke site design that enabled users to shortlist and create their own virtual light boxes while they browsed artist portfolios. These are instantly publishable as a zip, pdf or A4 print. The site design is dynamic and has a layout that adapts for optimal viewing on different screen sizes and devices. The backend is equally elegant, with a simple content management system that allows the client to fully manage and maintain the site independently.</span>

    A family company known for its premium quality lamb, Mirrool Creek commissioned One Iota to develop an entire brand identity, from the logo and marketing collateral through to an exciting new website<span>. The site adopts a non-traditional web design, with all the content on a single page.

  description: >
    The guys from Sourced Grocer looked to achieve a simple goal: procure fresh quality produce first hand from local farms and offer it for sale in the local area<span>, a modern take on your local neighbourhood grocer. The identity had to be as unique as their business model, challenging people to question their shopping habits and promote awareness in the local community. One Iota developed a brand culture that inspires people to buy locally, eat thoughtfully and have pride in the produce they consume. Executed across a range of collateral, we designed posters, promotional flyers and business cards through to signage and built environment.</span>
